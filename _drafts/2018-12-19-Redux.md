Its been almost a decade now since I've blogged and between then and now, I had lost my domain because I was an idiot and had not set a reminder to renew my domain. However the domain became available again and I bought it back. 

Getting back my domain has made me want to blog again (probably a lie) and I was looking for a some simple blogging platform and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) seemed like a good choice. Then one of my [friends](http://andyknight.net) suggested [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator which can be hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This works our really well for me as there is no databases to worry about and no hosting and its maintenance. I also stole [Phil Haack's blog design](https://haacked.com/archive/2018/12/11/haackbar-theme/) and slapped a dark theme on it. You can steal my blog design from [here](https://github.com/simplyvinay/simplyvinay.github.io).

For the future, I've been looking at [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) recently and how to have a .net implementation using it which I'll try and document in this space.
